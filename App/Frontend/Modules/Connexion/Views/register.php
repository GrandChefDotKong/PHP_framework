        <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Do a flip! Hey, whatcha watching? Okay, I like a challenge.</p>
        <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. <strong> It's okay, Bender.</strong> <em> I like cooking too.</em> Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p>
        <h2>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</h2>
        <p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Why would I want to know that? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Negative, bossy meat creature! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Can we have Bender Burgers again?</li><li>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</li><li>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Moving alongâ€¦</h3>
        <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! And then the battle's not so bad?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Say it in Russian!</li><li>Take me to your leader!</li><li>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bender?! You stole the atom. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
        <p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
        <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
        <p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. You are the last hope of the universe.</p>
        <p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!</p>
